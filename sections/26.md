### 26. Memory: Monitoring Usage and Tuning

  * Basic utilities for memory monitoring and tuning:

    | Utility | Purpose |
    | :------------- | :------------- |
    | `free` | summary of memory usage |
    | `vmstat` | detailed virtual memory stats and block I/O |
    | `pmap` | process memory map |

  * `/proc/sys/vm` has tunable values for the **virtual memory** system.
    One can modify by writing (as root) to the values there, or by using `sysctl`.
    Modifying `/etc/sysctl.conf` allows changes to persist between reboots.

  * `vmstat` displays memory info, paging info, I/O, processor activity and processes.
    Its general usage is `vmstat [options] [delay] [count]`. If *delay* is given  
    in seconds, the report is repeated *interval* times. The first line is an average  
    since boot up, followed by the requested report intervals.

    Example:
    ```
    $ vmstat 2 3
    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
    r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
    0  0      0 4830816  98532 1222756    0    0     3     4   25    2  1  0 99  0  0

    ```

    Description of Fields:
        r: The number of runnable processes (running or waiting for run time).
        b: The number of processes in uninterruptible sleep.
        swpd: the amount of virtual memory used.
        free: the amount of idle memory.
        buff: the amount of memory used as buffers.
        cache: the amount of memory used as cache.
        inact: the amount of inactive memory.  (-a option)
        active: the amount of active memory.  (-a option)
        si: Amount of memory swapped in from disk (/s).
        so: Amount of memory swapped to disk (/s).
        bi: Blocks received from a block device (blocks/s).
        bo: Blocks sent to a block device (blocks/s).
        in: The number of interrupts per second, including the clock.
        cs: The number of context switches per second.
        us: Time spent running non-kernel code.  (user time, including nice time)
        sy: Time spent running kernel code.  (system time)
        id: Time spent idle.  Prior to Linux 2.5.41, this includes IO-wait time.
        wa: Time spent waiting for IO.  Prior to Linux 2.5.41, included in idle.
        st: Time stolen from a virtual machine.  Prior to Linux 2.6.11, unknown.

    With the `-S m` switch, statistics will be given in MB instead of KB.

    With option `-a` `vmstat` displays active and inactive memory, active pages  
    being those that have been recently used; they may be clean (flushed to disk)  
    or dirty (needing to be flushed). Inactive pages have not recently been used  
    and more likely to be clean and released sooner under memory pressure.

    `-s` displays a table of event counters and statistics:
    ```
      $ vmstat -s
      8077596 K total memory
      1946380 K used memory
      2445052 K active memory
       480276 K inactive memory
      4802632 K free memory
       101860 K buffer memory
      1226724 K swap cache

     88597051 CPU context switches
    1458868004 boot time
        24592 forks
      ```

    `-d` displays disk statistics:
    ```
      $ vmstat -d
      disk- ------------reads------------ ------------writes----------- -----IO------
             total merged sectors      ms  total merged sectors      ms    cur    sec

    ```

    `-p [partition]` gives information on just one partition.

  * `/proc/meminfo` gives a lengthy summary of memory statistics.

  * After all memory and swap is exhausted, the OOM-killer (**O**ut **O**f **M**emory-killer)  
    is invoked to decide what should be exterminated to free up memory. A score is  
    used to determine which processes are terminated first. This value, labeled  
    "badness", can be read, for each process, at `/proc/<pid>/oom_score`. Two values  
    influence this score, and can be read from `oom_adj` and `oom_adj_score` in the  
    same directory. `oom_adj` adjusts (plus or minus) the badness score of a process,   
    and `oom_adj_score` is where the total badness score can be directly set.
