### 38. Network Addresses

  *  **IPv4** has four 8-bit octets, or bytes (range 0 to 255):
          0.0.0.0 to 255.555.255.255

    **IPv6** has 8 16-bit double octets, for example:
          0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000 to
          ffff.ffff.ffff.ffff.ffff.ffff.ffff.ffff

    Some addresses are reserved for system purposes.

  * **IPv4** address types:

      * `Unicast`: associated with one host, like `192.168.0.1`.

      * `Network`: address where the host portion is all zeroes (can be up to the
        last three octets) e.g.: `192.168.0.0`.

      * `Broadcast`: address to which each member of a network will listen; it will  
        have the host portion set to all 1's in its bitmask, or `255`, e.g.:
        `192.168.0.255`.

      * `Multicast`: address to which only specific nodes listen, like 224.0.0.2.

    Some addresses/ranges are reserved.

      * `127.x.x.x`: for local loopback devices, usually `127.0.0.1`.

      * `0.0.0.0`: for devices that don't know their own address; used by **DHCP**  
        and **BOOTP** when contacting servers.

      * `255.255.255.255`: general broadcast address, used internally.

  * **IPv6** address types:

      * `Unicast`: packets sent to one interface.
        * `Link-local`: auto-assigned, non-routable.
        * `Global`: dynamic or manual, routable.

      * `Multicast`: packet delivered to multiple interfaces.

      * `Anycast`: a packet delivered to the nearest routable interfaces.

      * `IPv4-mapped`: an **IPv4** address mapped to **IPv6**, e.g.: `::FFFF:a.b.c.d/96`.

    **IPv6** does have reserved addresses, like the loopback `::1/128`.

  * IP classes:

      | Network class | Octet range | Notes |
      | :------------- | :------------- | :----- |
      | A | 1-127 | 127.x.x.x reserved for `lo` |
      | B | 128-191 | n/a |
      | C | 192-223 | n/a |
      | D | 224-239 | Multicast addresses |
      | E | 240-254 | Reserved |

  * **Netmasks** are used to determine how much of an address is the network and  
    how much is the host.

    | class | Decimal | Hex | Binary |
    | :------------- | :------------- | :--- | :--- |
    | A | 255.0.0.0 | ff:00:00:00 | 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 |
    | B | 255.255.0.0 | ff:ff:00:00 | 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000 |
    | C | 255.255.255.0 | ff:ff:ff:00 | 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 |

    Using the logical AND operation (&) a network address can be derived from an
    IP address and a netmask:
        172.16.2.17 & 255.255.0.0 =
        10101100 00010000 00000010 00010001 &
        11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000 =
        -------------------------------------
        10101100 00010000 00000000 00000000 => 172.16.0.0 network address

    All nodes on the same network (same network address) can directly see each other.

  * A **hostname** is a label to uniquely distinguish it on a network, also called  
    a **nodename**.

    for DNS purposes, a hostname is appended with a `.domain.topleveldomain.` to  
    give a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):
        hostname: jeremiahpc
        domain:   home.net
        FQDN:     jeremiahpc.home.net.

  * Retrieve hostname:
        $ hostname
        wally

    Set hostname (non-persistent):
        $ sudo hostname lumpy
        lumpy

    Setting the hostname permanently is usually done by modifying `/etc/hostname`,
    though Red Hat may use `/etc/sysconfig/network`.

    `systemd`-based systems can use `hostnamectl`.

      * Retrieve hostname:
            hostnamectl status

      * Set hostname:
            sudo hostnamectl set-hostname MYPC
