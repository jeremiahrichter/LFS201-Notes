### 19. Linux Security Modules

  * **Security modules** should implement **mandatory access controls** over kernel
    requests in a way that:
    * Minimizes changes to the kernel
    * Minimizes overhead to the kernel
    * Permits flexibility and choice between different **L**inux **S**ecurity  
      **M**odules, or **LSM**

    The basic idea is to hook system calls or insert code whenever an application  
    makes a request to transition to system (kernel) mode. This code would make  
    sure permissions are correct and against malicious intent. It does this by  
    invoking security-related functional steps before/after a system call.

  * **SELinux** was the predominant security module in Linux since 2001, and the  
    **LSM** approach for extensible modules in 2003.

    The current **LSM** implementations are:
    * **SELinux**
    * **AppArmor**
    * **Smack**
    * **TOMOYO**

  * **SELinux** was developed by the **NSA** and was part of **RHEL** for a long  
    time, which gives it a large userbase. It is a set of security rules that de-  
    termine which processes can access files, directories, ports and other items.

    It works with three concepts:
    1. **Contexts**: labels to files, processes, ports, ex.: user, role, type
    2. **Rules**: Describe access control in terms of contexts, processes, files,  
      ports, users, etc.
    3. **Policies**: a set of rules that describe what system-wide access control  
      decisions should be made by **SELinux**.

    An **SELinux** context is a name used by a rule to define how users, pro-  
    cesses, files and ports interact with each other. As the default policy is  
    to deny any access, rules are used to describe allowed actions on the system.

    **SELinux** may be run in any of the following modes:
      * **Enforcing**: all **SELinux** code is operative and access is denied ac-  
        cording to policy. All violations are audited and logged.
      * **Permissive**: enables **SELinux** code but only audits and warns about  
        operations that would be denied in enforcing mode.
      * **Disabled**: completely disables **SELinux** kernel and application code  
        leaving the system without any of its protections.

    These modes are selected in a file (usually `/etc/selinux/config` or  
    `/etc/sysconfig/selinux` or some symlink thereof) and controlled by appro-
    priate commands:
      * `sestatus`: display current mode and policy
      * `getenforce`: examine current mode
      * `setenforce`: set current mode

    `setenforce` can switch between `Enforcing` and `Permissive` modes on the  
    fly, but not to `Disabled` mode without:
      * editing the config (`/etc/selinux/config`) file:
            SELINUX=disabled
      * booting with a kernel parameter:
            selinux=0
      **Note**: it is better to run in `Permissive` mode instead of disabling  
      **SELinux**, as that requires relabeling the entire filesystem when re-enabled.

    `/etc/sysconfig/selinux` also sets the **SELinux policy**. Multiple policies  
    are allowed, but only one can be active at one time. Changing the policy may  
    require a reboot and a re-label of the filesystem. Each policy has files that  
    must be installed under `/etc/selinux/[SELINUXTYPE]`.

    Common **policies** are:
      * **targeted**: the default policy where **SELinux** is more restricted to tar-  
        geted processes and user/`init` policies are not targeted.
      * **minimum**: a modification of the targeted policy where only selected  
        processes are protected.
      * **MLS** (**M**ulti-**L**evel **S**ecurity): very restricted; all processes  
        are placed in security domains with particular policies

    Four contexts (labels):
      * **User**
      * **Role**
      * **Type**
      * **Level**

    **Type** is most commonly used. Convention dictates that **type** labels should  
    end with `_t`, as in `kernel_t`.
