### 8. Devices and udev

  * character and block devices have filesystem entries; network devices do not.
  * a device driver may manage more than one device node under `/dev`
  * **major** and **minor** numbers identify the driver associated with the  
    device; the **minor** number is used by the device driver to differentiate
    between different devices controlled by the same driver
  * `udev` automates the creation of device nodes based on `udev rules`
  * `udev` runs as a daemon, either `udevd` or `systemd-udevd` which monitors a
    **netlink** socket, which the kernel `uevent` uses to send a message to `udev`
    and creates a device node based on rules
  * three components are:
    * `libudev` allows access to hardware info
    * `udevd` daemon maintains the `/dev` directory
    * `udevadm` for control and diagnosis
  * for a system without device nodes on boot, `initramfs` will have to have basic
    device nodes
  * `udev` works with hotplug system to use info in `/sys` `sysfs` system and  
    in config files:
    * main config file is `/etc/udev/udev.conf` and contains info on where to  
      place device nodes, default permissions, etc.
    * `/etc/udev/rules.d/` contains the default rules, which is scanned every  
      event from kernel about hardware is received
      * the files are named like `30-usb.rules` or `90-mycustom.rules`
      * format for udev rule:
        ```
        <match><op>value [, ...] <assignment><op>value [, ...]
        ```
        where the first part consists of match pairs with `==`, the second part
        with key-value pairs that assign values to names, like file name,
        permissions
      * example:
      ```
      KERNEL=="fuse", MODE="0666", OWNER="root", GROUP="root"
      ```
