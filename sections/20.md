### 20. Processes

* A **process** is a running application that may have more than one **thread**.  
  They have attributes, states and permissions. There are two modes, **user** and  
  **kernel**.

  * processes consist of:
    * environmental variables
    * open files
    * signal handlers
    * possibly child processes
    * **threads** or **tasks**, concurrently accessing shared resources, such as  
      memory addresses, open files, etc.
* they can be **heavy weight** or **light weight** processes, having to do  
  with resource sharing and speed of context switching between threads of  
  execution.

* threads are considered as separate processes but return the same PID (group ID  
  to the thread) but internally have individual thread IDs (process IDs to the  
  thread)
