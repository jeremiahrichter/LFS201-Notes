### 11. Linux Filesystems and the VFS
  * **VFS** is an abstraction layer (<b>V</b>irtual <b>F</b>ile <b>S</b>ystem)  
    that stands between the software and the on-disk file system
  * *raw* writing to disk (ignoring the filesystem) is dangerous
  * filesystems can be on hard disk partitions, `LVM`s or on a network drives
  * multiple filesystems can be mounted under a root partition at a mount point
  * some mounted filesystems are virtual(`/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`)
  * the **VFS** sits between the reading/writing I/O system calls and the hardware
    and handles the location and hardware
  * some filesystems don't have full user permissions and the **VFS** must add
    them
  * some filesystem drivers exist outside the kernel, but kernel-mode is faster
  * **journaling** filesystems recover from crashes with little to no corruption
    * they use transactions, meaning writes/updates occur **atomically**
    * there is a log file of transactions
  * `cat /proc/filesystems` => list of supported kernel filesystems
  * `tmpfs` is better than a `ramdisk` because it can be swapped, it uses  
    memory more efficiently, and doesn't need to be formatted before use
