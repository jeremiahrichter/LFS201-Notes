---

### Finding files
* `locate` uses `updatedb` which needs root, is indexed
* `file` is a recursive search, non-indexed, uses cwd  
    * `<no args>`: all files in cwd
    * `-name`: pattern in name, -iname is case-insensitive
    * `-type [d,l,f]`: filter by directory, link, file classification
    * `-exec [command] {} [';',\]` : run command on found files, must  
    terminate line with with either ';' or \\ to end command processing
    * `-ok`: same options and results as `-exec` but prompts before
      processing
    * `-ctime [days]`: find based on inode data changed (permissions,  
        ownership), use number of days, `+n` is greater than that range,  
        `-n` is less than, `n` is exactly that value
    * `-atime [days]`: uses last accessed/read time
    * `-mtime [days]`: uses modified/written time
    * `-cmin, -amin, -mmin`: are the same for minutes of time
    * `size [number{‚µÅ,c,k,M,G}]`: size can be searched, a raw number
      being used for 512-byte blocks, c for bytes, k for kilobytes, M
      megabytes, G gigabytes, `n`, `+n` `-n` meaning as above

---

### Backing up
* backup uses `cp` or `rsync`
    * `rsync` doesn't copy not changed files
    * `rsync` can remote copy using `[target]:[path]` where target
      can be `[user@]host`
    * `-r`: recursive copy
    * `-dry-run`: doesn't commit changes
* `gzip`, `bzip2`, `xz`, `zip` are compression programs
    * `gzip -r`: for recursive zipping, .gz extension
    * `gunzip`: for uncompressing, same as `gzip -d`
    * `bunzip2`: uncompressing bzip2 files, .bz2 extension
    * `xz` removes original; files after archiving, use `-k` to keep the files  
    `-d` to decompress
    * `zip, unzip` can use `-r`
* `tar` is tape archive, makes a 'tarball', can use compression
    * `tar xvf [file]`: extract verbosely a file named 'file'
    * `tar cvf [file]`: verbosely create a tarball named 'file'
    * `z`: add gzip compression
    * `j`: add bzip2 compression
    * `J`: add xz compression
* `dd` is disk-to-disk copying
    * `if=`: input disk device file
    * `of=`: output file/device
    * `bs=`: block size
    * `count=`: how many blocks to copy

---

### Authentication
* `sudo` is preferred to `su`
  * config in `/etc/sudoers` and in `/etc/sudoers.d/`
  * logs to `/var/log/secure`
  * use `visudo` to edit config
  * line entry is `who where = (as_whom) what`
  * add file to `/etc/sudoers.d/` with same name as user so as not  
    to edit the main file
  * commands run under `sudo` are logged to `/var/log/auth.log` in Debian  
    and family, `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/secure` on others

---

### Networking
* `/etc/hosts`: map of IP addresses to hostnames
* `/etc/resolve.conf`: order of where to look for info
* `host, dig`: look up IP's for hostnames
* Debian family network scripts are in `/etc/network/interfaces` and one can  
  start the network interfaces with `/etc/init.d/networking start`
  * For systemd-based systems, routing and host info are in
    `/etc/sysconfig/network` and interface scripts are in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`
  * you can start networks on those systems with `/etc/init.d/network start`, as well
* `/sbin/ip addr show`: for IP addresses
* `/sbin/ip route show`: for routing info
* `ping`: check attached machine to see if can send/receive
  * `-c number` is number of pings, or press `Ctrl-C` to exit

  parameters such as the speed.
* `netstat`	=> Displays all active connections and routing tables.  
  Useful for monitoring performance and troubleshooting.
* `nmap`: Scans open ports on a network. Important for security analysis
* `tcpdump`: Dumps network traffic for analysis.

    in /etc/passwd separated by a space for every line
* `sort` sorts lines of text
  * `sort -u`: filters out unique values after sorting; `uniq` filters but requires  
    sorted input, so `sort -u` saves a step
  * `sort -r`: sorts in reverse order

  *characters* for another set, one for one from inputfile and saves to outputfile
  * `-c` is a set complement, `-d` is to delete
* `tee 'newfile'` reads output to the screen and saves the output as well to newfile

  * `/etc/cups/{cupsd.conf,printers.conf}`: config files for CUPS
    * `cupsd.conf`: system-wide and network configuration
    * `printers.conf`: specific settings for printers, don't hand-modify
  * `/var/spool/cups/` stores files for when they are sent to a printer for

  * `/etc/cups/ppd/` where connected printers' have config files
  * `http://localhost:631` is address for cups web interface

---

### Shell Scripting
* `#!/path/to/interpreter`: need an interpreter, can be perl/python/bash/tcsh...
* `read VARIABLE_NAME` to read input
* `echo $?` to see exit value of child process
* one can declare functions:
      function_name () {
        command...
      }
  to repeat tasks; arguments are the auto-variables `$1`, `$2`, etc...
* At times, you may need to substitute the result of a command as a portion of  
  another command. It can be done in two ways:
  * By enclosing the inner command with backticks (\`)
  * By enclosing the inner command in `$( )`, this allows nesting
  * `var=value`: setting of variables; `$var` to read; `export var` for child  
    processes to access
  * arguments to script:
    * `$0`: script name
    * `$1,$2,$3`: additional parameters, `$*` for all in an array
    * `$#`: number of arguments
* In compact form, the syntax of an if statement is:
      if TEST-COMMANDS; then CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS; fi
  A more general definition is:
      if condition
      then
       statements
      else
       statements
      fi
* `elif`: can be used for subsequent truth testing after first `if`
* `[[]]`: double brackets should surround the test condition
* can be used like:
      if [ -f /etc/passwd ] ; then
        ACTION
      fi
  with different test conditions(`man 1 test` for full list):
      Condition Meaning
      -e file	Check if the file exists.
      -d file	Check if the file is a directory.
      -f file	Check if the file is a regular file (i.e.,
        not a symbolic link, device node, directory, etc.)
      -s file	Check if the file is of non-zero size.
      -g file	Check if the file has sgid set.
      -u file	Check if the file has suid set.
      -r file	Check if the file is readable.
      -w file	Check if the file is writable.
      -x file	Check if the file is executable.
* strings can be tested with `==` operator
* numbers can be tested with these operators:
      Operator  Meaning
      -eq	Equal to
      -ne	Not equal to
      -gt	Greater than
      -lt	Less than
      -ge	Greater than or equal to
      -le	Less than or equal to
* Arithmetic expressions can be evaluated in the following three ways  
  (spaces are important!):
  Using the `expr` utility: `expr` is a standard but somewhat deprecated program.  
  The syntax is as follows:

  `expr 8 + 8;
  echo $(expr 8 + 8)`

  Using the `$((...))` syntax: This is the built-in shell format. The syntax is as  
  follows:

  `echo $((x+1))`
  Using the built-in shell command let. The syntax is as follows:

  `let x=( 1 + 2 ); echo $x`
  In modern shell scripts the use of `expr` is better replaced with `var=$((...))`

---

### Advanced Bash Scripting
* string operators:
      Operator	Meaning
      [[ string1 > string2 ]]	Compares the sorting order of string1 and string2.
      [[ string1 == string2 ]]	Compares the characters in string1 with the characters in string2.
      myLen1=${#string1}	Saves the length of string1 in the variable myLen1.
* parts of a string:
  At times, you may not need to compare or use an entire string. To extract the  
  first character of a string we can specify:

  `${string:0:1}`: Here 0 is the offset in the string (i.e., which character to  
  begin from) where the extraction needs to start and 1 is the number of
  characters to be extracted.

  To extract all characters in a string after a dot (.), use the following
   expression: `${string#*.}`
* `-z` tests a string for the empty string ''
* boolean expressions:
      &&  AND "both true"
      ||  OR  "either true"
      !   NOT "only if false"
* case structure:
      case expression in
         pattern1) execute commands;;
         pattern2) execute commands;;
         pattern3) execute commands;;
         pattern4) execute commands;;
         * )       execute some default commands or nothing ;;
      esac
* for loop:
      for variable-name in list
      do
          execute one iteration for each item in the
                  list until the list is finished
      done
* while loop:
      while condition is true
      do
          Commands for execution
          ----
      done
* until loop:
  The until loop repeats a set of statements as long as the control  
  command is false. Thus it is essentially the opposite of the while loop.  
  The syntax is:

      until condition is false
      do
          Commands for execution
          ----
      done
* script debugging:
  Before fixing an error (or bug), it is vital to know its source.

  In bash shell scripting, you can run a script in debug mode by doing  
  `bash ‚Äìx ./script_file`. Debug mode helps identify the error because:

  It traces and prefixes each command with the + character.
  It displays each command before executing it.
  It can debug only selected parts of a script (if desired) with:
  `set -x `   # turns on debugging
  ...
  `set +x`    # turns off debugging

### Processes
* `ps`: displays all processes under the running shell
  * `-u`: specify a username by which to filter
  * `-ef`: full detail
  * `-eLf`: one line for each process thread
  * `aux`: all processes for all users
  * `axo <qualifiers>`: specify which columns, like `stat`,`priority`,`pid`,  
    `pcpu` or `comm`
* `pstree`: shows a list of processes in a tree based on PPID
* `top`: realtime list of processes and resource use
  * *load average*: The load average determines how busy the system is.  
    A load average of 1.00 per CPU indicates a fully subscribed, but not  
    overloaded, system. If the load average goes above this value, it indicates  
    that processes are competing for CPU time. If the load average is very  
    high, it might indicate that the system is having a problem, such as a  
    runaway process (a process in a non-responding state).
  * The second line of the top output displays the total number of processes,  
    the number of running, sleeping, stopped and zombie processes. Comparing  
    the number of running processes with the load average helps determine if  
    the system has reached its capacity or perhaps a particular user is running  
    too many processes. The stopped processes should be examined to see if  
    everything is running correctly.
  * The percentage of user jobs running at a lower priority (niceness - ni)  
    is then listed. Idle mode (id) should be low if the load average is high,  
    and vice versa. The percentage of jobs waiting (wa) for I/O is listed.  
    Interrupts include the percentage of hardware (hi) vs. software  
    interrupts (si). Steal time (st) is generally used with virtual machines,  
    which has some of its idle CPU time taken for other uses.
  * list of columns:
        Process Identification Number (PID)
        Process owner (USER)
        Priority (PR) and nice values (NI)
        Virtual (VIRT), physical (RES), and shared memory (SHR)
        Status (S)
        Percentage of CPU (%CPU) and memory (%MEM) used
        Execution time (TIME+)
        Command (COMMAND)
  * key commands:
        Command	Output
        t	Display or hide summary information (rows 2 and 3)
        m	Display or hide memory information (rows 4 and 5)
        A	Sort the process list by top resource consumers
        r	Renice (change the priority of) a specific processes
        k	Kill a specific process
        f	Enter the top configuration screen
        o	Interactively select a new sort order in the process list
* load average can be found by `w`, `top` or `uptime`, it's usually listed in  
  1, 5 and 15-minute increments
* 1.00 is a system utilizing resources, but not overly so. The number must be  
  divided by # of CPUs in system:

      If we had more than one CPU, say a quad-CPU system, we would divide the  
      load average numbers by the number of CPUs. In this case, for example,  
      seeing a 1 minute load average of 4.00 implies that the system as a whole  
      was 100% (4.00/4) utilized during the last minute.

* You can either use `CTRL-Z` to suspend a foreground job or `CTRL-C` to  
  terminate a foreground job and can always use the `bg` and `fg` commands to  
  run a process in the background and foreground, respectively.
* use `jobs` to see backgrounded processes
  * `-l`: shows PID as well
* `at` can be used to run commands once at a future date/time
* `cron` can schedule repeating tasks:
  * `/etc/crontab`: main configuration file, don't usually edit this one
  * `crontab -e`: edits that user's crontab file, there are 6 fields:
        Field	Description	Values
        MIN	Minutes	0 to 59
        HOUR	Hour field	0 to 23
        DOM	Day of Month	1-31
        MON	Month field	1-12
        DOW	Day Of Week	0-6 (0 = Sunday)
        CMD	Command	Any command to be executed
* `sleep`: can be used to pause execution in a script to wait for a resource  
  to become available
