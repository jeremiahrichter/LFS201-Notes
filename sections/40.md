### 40. Firewalls

  * Firewalls can be configured:
    * from CLI tools using files in `/etc/`:
          iptables
          firewall-cmd
          ufw
    * or graphical tools:
          system-config-firewall
          firewall-config
          gufw
          yast

  * `firewalld` is part of `systemd` systems, config files are:
        /etc/firewalld
        /usr/lib/firewalld

    The actual command is `firewall-cmd`. It replaces the older `iptables` and
    should not be run concurrently.

    Show if it's running:
        sudo firewall-cmd --state

    One may have to turn on IP forwarding:
        sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    Or:
        sudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    Or, for persistency, add to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
        net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    and reboot.

    `firewalld` works with **zones** and known behavior for incoming/outgoing packets.
    Each interface belongs to a particular zone but this can be changed with `firewall-cmd`
    or `firewall-config`.

    Zones are:
      * `drop`: incoming dropped no reply, outgoing permitted.
      * `block`: incoming rejected unless from within system.
      * `public`: only selected incoming connections are permitted.
      * `external`: used with masquerading, same as `public`.
      * `dmz`: used when some services allowed to public, only particular connections
        allowed.
      * `work`: somewhat trust network node connections, only certain allowed.
      * `home`: trust network nodes more than `work`, but still only allow certain.
      * `internal`: similar to `work`.
      * `trusted`: all connections allowed.

    Get the default zone:
        sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
    List of zones in use:
        sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
    List available zones:
        sudo firewall-cmd --get-zones
    Set default zone (to trusted in example):
        sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=trusted
    Set an interface's zone, temporarily:
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --change-interface=eno1
