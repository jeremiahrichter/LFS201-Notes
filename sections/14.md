### 14. The Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 Filesystems

  * `ext2`: Linux's original native filesystem
  * `ext3`: first journaling extension to `ext2`
  * `ext4`: appeared in kernel 2.6.19, can use extents for large files, instead  
    of lists for file blocks
    * **extent**: a group of contiguous blocks. Using these improves file  
      performance and decreases fragmentation
    * is default in a lot of distros, but **RHEL 7** has adopted `xfs`
  * **VFS** and `ext*` family are similar and were designed with each other in  
    mind
    * **block size** is selected when formatting partition, can be
      1. 512 bytes
      2. 1024 bytes
      3. 2048 bytes
      4. 4096 bytes
        * **Notes**: 4096 bytes is used for hard drives unless partition is  
          small, can be efficient in hard drive accesses
    * kernel memory management requires integer block numbers that fit within a  
      page of memory, i.e.: cannot have 8k block size on 4k page size system
    * number of `inodes` may be tuned for efficiency of disk space, **inode  
      reservation** can reserve a certain # of `inodes` when directory created  
      so when file is created an `inode` doesn't have to be allocated
    * if path of symlink is less than 60 characters, a fast symbolic link is  
      stored directly in the `inode` so no data block has to be created
  * in `ext4` all fields written to in little-endian order except journaling
  * uses **block groups** where inode and data blocks are stored together to  
    lower access times
  * data blocks are pre-allocated to files before they are actually used to re-  
    duce fragmentation
  * the filesystem **superblock** contains bitfields to determine whether the  
    filesystem needs checking, can be:
        clean: mounted cleanly unmounted previously
        dirty: usually means mounted
        unknown: not cleanly unmounted, e.g.: after a crash
    `fsck` run on latter two options
  * the first block on the filesystem is the **boot block** reserved for the  
    partition boot sector
  * after the boot block there are equally-sized block groups in the below layout:
    **Super block | Group Descriptor  | Data Block Bitmap | Inode Bitmap  | Inode  
    Table (*n* blocks)  | Data Blocks (*n* blocks)**
  * first and second blocks used by kernel, usually just the first block group,  
    but other copies can be pulled if that one corrupted
  * number of block groups constrained by having to fit in a single block in the  
    block bitmap
  * `dumpe2fs`: scans filesystem info
  * `tune2fs`: change filesystem parameters
    * `sudo tune2fs -c 25 [devicefile]`: change max number of mounts between checks
    * `sudo tune2fs -i 10 [devicefile]`: change time interval between checks
    * `sudo tune2fs -l [devicefile]`: list attributes than can be changed and values
  * the **superblock** contains global info about the filesystem:
    * mount count and max mount count before `fsck`
    * block size, can't be bigger than a page of memory
    * blocks per group
    * free block count
    * free inode count
    * operating system ID
  * the **superblock** is redundantly stored in several block groups
  * the **data block** and **inode** bitmaps are blocks whose bits store which  
    blocks/inodes are free as a 0 or 1
  * the **inode table** contains as many consecutive blocks as are necessary to  
    cover the number of inodes in the block group; each inode requires 128 bytes.
    A 4 KB block can store 32 inodes
  * there is reserved space for OS-dependent info that Linux doesn't use, but another  
    OS mounting the partition might
  * the inode number is not stored on disk but calculated from block group number  
    and offset in the inode table
  * `ext2`/`ext3` used `i_block[]` array of pointers to data blocks instead of  
    extents, so:
      * first 12 elements pointed to first 12 data blocks
      * 13th pointed to another `iblock[]` pointed to another array, etc.
  * `ext4` is:
    * backwards-compatible with `ext2`/`ext3`
    * maximum filesystem size is 1 EB, maximum file size is 16 TB (48-bit addressing)
    * no limit to subdirectories
    * splits large files into the largest possible extents
    * multiblock allocation allocates all space at once
    * space can be pre-allocated, which is contiguous and guaranteed
    * can use **allocate-on-flush** for performance
    * uses fast `fsck`
    * uses checksums for the journal for reliability
    * timestamps in nanoseconds
    * snapshot support
