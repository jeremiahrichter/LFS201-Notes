### 14. The Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 Filesystems

  * `ext2`: Linux's original native filesystem
  * `ext3`: first journaling extension to `ext2`
  * `ext4`: appeared in kernel 2.6.19, can use extents for large files, instead  
    of lists for file blocks
    * **extent**: a group of contiguous blocks. Using these improves file  
      performance and decreases fragmentation
    * is default in a lot of distros, but **RHEL 7** has adopted `xfs`
  * **VFS** and `ext*` family are similar and were designed with each other in  
    mind
    * **block size** is selected when formatting partition, can be
      1. 512 bytes
      2. 1024 bytes
      3. 2048 bytes
      4. 4096 bytes
        * **Notes**: 4096 bytes is used for hard drives unless partition is  
          small, can be efficient in hard drive accesses
    * kernel memory management requires integer block numbers that fit within a  
      page of memory, i.e.: cannot have 8k block size on 4k page size system
    * number of `inodes` may be tuned for efficiency of disk space, **inode  
      reservation** can reserve a certain # of `inodes` when directory created  
      so when file is created an `inode` doesn't have to be allocated
    * if path of symlink is less than 60 characters, a fast symbolic link is  
      stored directly in the `inode` so no data block has to be created
  * in `ext4` all fields written to in little-endian order except journaling
  * uses **block groups** where inode and data blocks are stored together to  
    lower access times
  * data blocks are pre-allocated to files before they are actually used to re-  
    duce fragmentation
  * the filesystem **superblock** contains bitfields to determine whether the  
    filesystem needs checking, can be:
        clean: mounted cleanly unmounted previously
        dirty: usually means mounted
        unknown: not cleanly unmounted, e.g.: after a crash
    `fsck` run on latter two options
  * the first block on the filesystem is the **boot block** reserved for the  
    partition boot sector
  * after the boot block there are equally-sized block groups:
