### 15. The XFS and btrfs Filesystems

  * **XFS** was originally designed by **SGI** and used in the **IRIX** OS and  
    was subsequently ported to **Linux**. I was for large data sets as well as  
    to handle parallel I/O
    * 16 EB maximum filesystem size
    * 8 EB for an individual file
    High performance is is implemented with:
    * **DMA** or **D**irect **M**emory **A**ccess I/O
    * Adjusting stripe size to adjust to underlying RAID or LVM Devices
    * can journal quota info
    * journal can be on another device
    * supports extended attributes
    * maintenance can be done while mounted
    * backup and restore can be done with native utilities `xfsdump` and  
      `xfsrestore`, which can be paused and resumed
    * no direct support of snapshots, but `xfs-freeze` can halt filesystem activity  
      to allow a snapshot to be taken
    * quotas are supported on per-filesystem basis with normal utilities, but  
      `xfs-quota` can give per-directory control
  * **btrfs** (**B**-**Tr**ee **F**ile**s**ystem) addresses lack of pooling,  
    snapshots, checksums and integral multi-device spanning in other Filesystems
    * uses copy-on-write to make snapshots of entire filesystems or sub-volumes  
      in very little time
      * one can easily revert to prior snapshot or force kernel to boot from other  
        snapshot of root filesystem
    * `btrfs` maintains own framework to add/remove partitions to existing filesystems,
      much like **LVM**
