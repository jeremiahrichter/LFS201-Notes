### 16. Logical Volume Management (LVM)

  * **LVM** groups one or more **physical volumes** into **volume groups**, which  
    can be sub-divided into **logical volumes**, which mimic nominal disk partitions.
  * `system-config-lvm`: popular GUI LVM utility, not up-to-date
  * **LVM** does have performance cost, but one can use RAID **striping** to  
    compensate
  * can be combined with RAID for redundancy
  * partitions are converted to **physical volumes** and more than one are grouped
    into **volume groups**:
      * space is divided into extents, 4 MB in size by default, but can be changed  
        when allocated
      * `vgcreate`: create a volume group
