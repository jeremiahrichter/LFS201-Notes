### 41. Basic Troubleshooting

  * Troubleshooting steps:

    1.  Characterize problem.
    2.  Reproduce problem.
    3.  Try easy fixes first.
    4.  Eliminate causes one at a time.
    5.  Change only one thing at a time.
    6.  Check system logs `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/secure`, etc.

  * Networking troubleshooting:

    * check `ip` or `ifconfig` to see if interface up.
    * use `lsmod` to make sure the correct driver is installed.
    * use `ping` to test network visibility.
    * use `traceroute` to track packets through network.
    * find routing info with `route -n`.
    * run `dig` to test host DNS.

  * Package troubleshooting:

    * use `rpm -V package` to test a package.
    * maybe try `debsums options somepackage` to verify Debian system package.

  * Boot troubleshooting:

    * check GRUB misconfiguration, may need to reinstall boot loader.
    * kernel panics can be a corrupt/misconfigured kernel, or parameters.
    * check `/etc/fstab` if root doesn't mount, or initramfs doesn't have module.
    * pay attention to error messages, try lower runlevel.
