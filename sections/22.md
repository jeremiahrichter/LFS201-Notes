### 22. System Monitoring

  * System monitoring use a lot of pseudo-filesystem information from `/sys` and  
    `/proc`

  * | utility | purpose |
  | :------------- | :------------- |
  | top | process activity |
  | uptime | how long the system has been running |
  | ps | detailed process information |
  | pstree | a tree of processes and their relationships |
  | mpstat | multi-processor usage |
  | iostat | CPU load and I/O stats |
  | sar | Display and collect information about system activity |
  | numastat | **NUMA** info (**N**on-**U**niform **M**emory **A**rchitecture) |
  | strace | Information about system calls that a process makes |
  | free | memory usage |

  * `/proc` entries may be writable (by **root**)

  * Tunable parameters are mostly found under `/proc/sys`, ex:
        [root@archlinux ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        60910
        [root@archlinux ~]# echo 100000 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        [root@archlinux ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        63106
  * `/sys` is part of the **Unified Device Model**, behaves like a **device tree**,  
    contains info not only related to devices, like kernel modules, etc.

  * `sar` stands for **S**ystems **A**ctivity **R**eporter, on Linux it is a backend  
    for `sadc` (system activity data collector), which stores data in `/car/log/sa`
    usually daily.

    * Usage: `sar [options] [interval] [count]`, where the report is repeated after
      *interval* seconds for *count* times

    * | options | meaning |
    | :------------- | :------------- |
    | `-A` | almost all info |
    | `-b` | I/O and transfer rate |
    | `-B` | paging statistics |
    | `-x` | block device activity |
    | `-n` | network stats |
    | `-P` | per-CPU statistics |
    | `-q` | queue lengths |
    | `-r` | swap and memory utilization |
    | `-R` | memory statistics |
    | `-u` | CPU usage (default) |
    | `-v` | inodes/file handles |
    | `-w` | context switching statistics |
    | `-W` | pages in/out per second |
    | `-f` | extract info from file with `-o` option |
    | `-o` | save readings to a file |
