### 39. Network Devices and Configuration

  * Instead of `eth0, eth1`, `udev` and `systemd` have incorporated bus location
    into the naming of network devices, ex:
      * `enp2s0`: would be PCI bus 2, slot 0 (sometimes a function number), like
        `02:00.0` from `lspci`.

      * Instead of `wlan0` for a wireless card, `wlp3s0` would be wireless card
        on PCI interface `03:00.0`.

  * **NIC** configuration info is stored at various places among the distros.
    RHEL 6 uses `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`.

    openSUSE 13.1 would use `/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eno16777736`.

    Debian-based, like Ubuntu, would use `/etc/network/interfaces`.

  * Bring down an interface:
        ifdown eth0

    Bring it up:
        ifup eth0

  * `ifconfig` is an older UNIX tool for controlling network interfaces.

    Display info on all interfaces:
        ifconfig
    Just on `eth0`:
        ifconfig eth0
    Set the IP address:
        sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.50
    Set the netmask to 24 bit:
        sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0
    Bring up interface:
        sudo ifconfig eth0 up
    Bring down the interface:
        sudo ifconfig eth0 down
    Set the MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit):
        sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1480

  * `ip` is a newer and faster utility, using `netlink` sockets over `ioctl()` calls.
    Its basic syntax is:
        ip [options] OBJECT
