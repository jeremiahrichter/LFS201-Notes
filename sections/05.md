### 5. Linux Filesystem Tree Layout

  * files/folders are organized between *sharable/non-sharable* and *variable/static*
    * *sharable* files can be shared across hosts
    * *static* files don't change without administrator intervention,       
      *variable* files might change on their own
  * **FHS** or **F** ile **H** ierarchy **S** tandard is administered by
    the **Free Standards Group** and now the **Linux Foundation**, specifies  
    what directories need to be present and purpose, not followed exactly
  * no package should make new root directories
  * `/boot` essential files for booting:
    * `vmlinuz`: compressed linux kernel
    * `initramfs`: initial RAM filesystem, mounted before real root filesystem  
    becomes available
    * `config`: config file for kernel compilation
    * `System.map`: kernel symbol table, used for debugging
  * `/dev` holds device files, also called *nodes*, respresent devices connected  
    to the system, network devices have names like `eth1` or `wlan0`
    * modern systems use `udev`, which creates device nodes when devices are  
      added or connected
  * `/home` contains users' files and directories, and sometimes groups
    * `$HOME`: shell environmental variable that contains the current user's  
      home directory path, aliased to `~`
    * root's home directory resides at `/root`
  * `/media`: automounted media are mounted under here, being replaced by  
    `/run/media/[username]`
  * `/mnt`: temporary mount point for `NFS`, `Samba`, `CIFS` and `AFS`
  * `/opt`: for software packages that don't want files scattered throughout  
    the filesystem
  * `/proc`: pseudo-filesystem in memory with kernel data structures and  
    processes
    * `/proc/interrupts`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/mounts`, `/proc/partitions`  
    are up-to-date views of hardware
    * `/proc/filesystems` and `/proc/sys/` provide system config and interfaces
    * `/sys`: mount point for `sysfs`, in-memory, provides system info  
      and can modify system values
  * `/tmp`: for temp files, accessed by any user/app, are deleted by `cron`
    jobs, reboots, sometimes is a `ramfs`
  * `/usr` is a **secondary hierarchy**, for files not needed for booting  
    can be mounted over the network
    * software packages shouldn't create subdirectories under `/usr`
    * typically read-only data, may have binaries not used in single-user  
      mode
    * `/usr/share/man`: where `man` pages are stored
  * `/var` contains *variable*, or *volatile* data files that change
    frequently during system operation:
    * log files
    * spool files for printing/mail queues
    * admin data files
    * cache contents
    * for security reasons `/var` is often a separate filesystem
    * `/var/log`: most of the log files are here
    * `/var/spool`: local files for mail/printing/cron jobs
  * `/run` is new directory tree used by many major
    * not officially accepted by the **FHS**
    * is to store transient files and runtime info
    * usually an empty mount point with `tmpfs` ram disk like
      `/dev/shm` mounted there at runtime
    * `/var/run`, `/var/lock` can be symbolic links under `/run`,  
      among others
  * `/lib`: libraries for binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`
    * kernel modules are often under `/lib/modules/<kernel-version-number>`
    * **PAM** (**P** luggable **A** uthentication **M** odules) are  
      stored under `/lib/security`
    * `/lib64` may exist to separate 32-bit and 64-bit libraries if  
      they exist side-by-side
  * `/bin`: executables and scripts for system admins and users  
    that are required before mounting other filesystems, like in  
    single-user or recovery mode
    * no subdirectories
    * some non-essential binaries go into `/usr/bin`
  * `/sbin` has binaries essential for booting, restoring, recovering  
    or repairing, must be able to mount
  * recent distros have been combining `/bin` and `/sbin` into their  
    `/usr` versions and sym-linking back to their root locations
