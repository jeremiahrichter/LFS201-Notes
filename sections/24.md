### 24. I/O Monitoring and Tuning

  * `iostat` is the basic workhorse for monitoring I/O activity:
    ```
    $ iostat
    Linux 4.4.1-2-ARCH (archlinux.home.net) 	03/24/2016 	_x86_64_	(8 CPU)

    avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
               2.33    0.06    1.22    0.47    0.00   95.92

    Device:            tps    kB_read/s    kB_wrtn/s    kB_read    kB_wrtn
    sda               8.40       108.20        77.35    1098790     785492
    sdb               0.07         6.54         0.00      66424          0
    ```
    **tps** being **T**ransactions **P**er **S**econd.

    Options:

    * `-k`: results in KB
    * `-m`: results in MB
    * `-N`: to show by device name
    * `-d`: for a different format
    * `-xk`: more detailed report, ex:
    ```
      $ iostat -xk
      Linux 4.4.1-2-ARCH (archlinux.home.net) 	03/24/2016 	_x86_64_	(8 CPU)

      avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
                 2.57    0.06    1.40    0.45    0.00   95.51

      Device:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rkB/s    wkB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util
      sda               0.61     2.92    3.88    4.38   104.15    79.83    44.57     0.28   33.40   11.73   52.60   3.33   2.75
      sdb               0.00     0.00    0.06    0.00     6.28     0.00   195.36     0.00    1.69    1.69    0.00   1.43   0.01
    ```

      where the fields have different meanings:

      | fields | meanings |
      | :------------- | :------------- |
      | Device | device or partition name |
      | rrqm/s | queued read requests merged per second |
      | wrqm/s | queued write requests merged per second |
      | r/s | read requests per second issued to device |
      | w/s | write requests per second issued to device |
      | rkB/s | KB read per second |
      | wkB/s | KB written per second |
      | avgrq-sz | average request size in 512 byte sectors per second |
      | avgqu-sz | average queue length of requests issued to device |
      | await | average time between issued/completed in msecs |
      | svctm | average service time in msecs for requests |
      | %util | percentage of CPU time during requests |

  * `iotop` displays current I/O usage and updates over time, like `top`.

  * `ionice` lets priorities and classes to be set for I/O on a process.

    Usage: `ionice [-c class] [-n priority] [-p pid] [COMMAND ARGS]`

    Classes being one of three:
      * `-c 1`: Idle, no access to I/O unless no other process asking for it
      * `-c 2`: Best effort, round-robin, default
      * `-c 3`: Real-time, first access, can starve other processes

        Note: priority determines timeslice
