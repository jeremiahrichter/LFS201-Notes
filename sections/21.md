### 21. Signals

* Signals emit notifications to take action in response to unpredictable events.  
  These can be internal or external to the application. One can "handle" a signal  
  within a program's code to avoid straight termination.

* One of the oldest forms of **IPC** (**Inter-Process Communication**) and notify  
  processes about **asynchronous** events.

  **Asynchronous** means:
    * the event not expected

    * the event was expected, but the time unknown

  There are two ways signals are sent to processes:
    1. from kernel to user process from an exception or error

    2. from a user process to the kernel to another user process (they may be the  
      same process)

  Processes must be owned by the same user (or be superuser) to send signals to  
  each other. When a signal is received, a process may **handle** the signal (this  
  must be programmed in) or respond by system defaults. Two signals, **SIGKILL**  
  and **SIGSTOP**, cannot be handled.
