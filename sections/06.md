### 6. Kernel Services and Configuration

  * Narrowly defined, **Linux** is only the **kernel** of the operating system,  
    which contains libraries and applications that interact with the **kernel**
  * the **kernel** connects the hardware to the software and manages system  
    resources, handles device drivers
  * parameters can be passed on the **kernel command line**, usually on the  
   `kernel` line of the `GRUB` config file (or `linux16` line)
    * to view these parameters use `cat /proc/cmdline`
    * kernel parameters can be found in kernel source under
      `Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt`
    * at http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
    * possibly with a package called `kernel-doc` or `linux-doc`
    * under `man bootparam`
      ```
      ro: mount root device as read-only
      root: root filesystem
      rd_LVM_LV: activate root filesystem in the logical volume specified
      rd_NO_LUKS: disables LUKS detection
      rd_NO_DM: disables DM RAID detection
      LANG: system language
      SYSFONT: console font
      KEYTABLE: keytable filename
      ```
        * *Note*: `rd`- prefixed options are usually only for RedHat distros
  * `sysctl`: used to read and tune kernel parameters at runtime
    * `sysctl -a`: list all options; each option corresponds with pseudofiles
      under `/proc/sys/`, with directory slashes being replaced by dots
    * `sysctl path.to.pseudofile=value`
    * settings can be made persistent across reboots by adding the settings to
      `/etc/sysctl.conf`, can be purged with `sudo sysctl -p`, sometimes the  
      file is in `/usr/lib/sysctl.d/00-system`
