### 9. Partitioning and Formatting Disks

  * rotational media have `heads`, which read `tracks`, groups of which are
    called `cylinders` when they are in the same location on all platters,  
    which are separated into `sectors`, mostly **512** bytes but can be  
    **4096**
  * disks may be divided into contiguous sectors/cylinders or `partitions`
  * with **M** aster **B** oot **R** ecord, there can be **4** primary  
    partitions, one of which can be an *extended* partition, which can be  
    sub-divided until the max partition limit is reached (usually **15**)
  * **Linux** does not require partitions to begin/end on cylinder boundaries,
    but will try to play nice with other OSes and do this
  * there are reasons to partition:
        Separation, like `/home` on own partition
        Sharing, like between other OSes
        Security, like quotas for different parts of the system
        Size, as some data are constant, and some grow, like the `/var` folder
        Performance, like near the center of a platter
        Swap, as Linux likes to have a separate swap partition
  * the **MBR** contains the partition table, is **512 bytes** in length
    * the partition table is **64 bytes** long and placed after the **446
      byte** boot record, which has program code, usually the boot loader.
    * only one partition may be marked as active, where boot loader looks for
      items to load
    * each entry on partition table is 16 bytes long, describing one of four  
      possible partitions, containing:
      * active bit
      * beginning address in cylinder/heads/sectors format (ignored by  
        **Linux**)
      * partition type code (`xfs`, `LVM`, `ntfs`, `swap`, etc.)
      * ending address in **CHS** format (ignored by **Linux**)
      * start sector counting from zero
      * number of sectors in partition
    * Linux uses the last two fields for **L** ogical **B** lock  
    **A** ddressing (**LBA**)
  * device nodes are usually accessed through Linux's **VFS** or **V** irtual
    **F** ile **S** ystem; writing to device nodes directly is dangerous
  * **SCSI** and **SATA** drives follow simple naming scheme: `/dev/sd{a,b,c,...}`
    with partitions being numbered suffixes, eg: `/dev/sda1`
  * **SCSI** devices are enumerated by controller # (a,b,c part) then device #
    (1,2,3 part)
  * `blkid` is a utility to locate block devices and report on their attributes
    * uses `libblkid`
    * can take a device as an argument
    * only works on non-empty partition
  * `lsblk` lists block devices in a tree format
  * Linux systems should use a minimum of two partitions:
    * `/` but there are usually more mount points under root for data security
      and easy backup
    * `swap`: used as extension of physical memory; non-file-mapped pages are
      moved to disk until needed
  * backup of **MBR**: `sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbrbackup bs=512 count=1`
  * restore **MBR**: `sudo dd if=mbrbackup of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1`
  * `fdisk`: menu-driven partition editor
  * `sfdisk`: non-interactive `fdisk` for scripting
  * `parted`: **GNU** partition program
  * `gparted`: **GTK** frontend for `parted`
  * `fdisk` commands:
    ```
    m: display the menu
    p: print the partition
    n: new partition
    d: delete a partition
    t: change a partition type
    w: write the partition table info
    q: quit without saving changes
    ```
    * can use `sudo partprobe -s` to re-read partition table, but best to  
      reboot
