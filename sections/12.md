### 12. Filesystem Features: Attributes, Creating, Checking, Mounting
  * an `inode` is a data structure on disk that describes and stores file  
    attributes including location. Every file has an `inode`. the `inode` stores:
        Permissions
        User and group ownership
        Size
        Timestamps in nanoseconds:
          - last access time
          - last modification time
          - change time
        filenames not stored in an inode, but in a directory file
    all I/O activity involves updating the file's `inode` as well as the file's  
    data
  * `directory file`: file that associates file names and inodes. Two ways to  
    associate:
      1. **Hard** links point at an `inode`
      2. **Soft** (symbolic) links point to a file name that has an `inode`
    * each association of directory file to `inode` is called a link
    * `ln` is command to make new links
    * because more than one directory file can point to one `inode`, a file can  
      have more than one name, but a file can only have one `inode`
    * programs search for `inodes` in directories and the path/name is used as  
      an `inode` number in memory
  * **Extended Attributes** associate metadata not interpreted by the filesystem  
    directly with files. Four namespaces exist:
        User
        Trusted
        Security
        System
    The system namespace is used for **ACL**s or **A**ccess **C**ontrol **L**ists,
    and security is used by **SELinux**
    * values are stored in the `inode` and can be set only by `root`
      * `lsattr` to view and `chattr` to set flags:
            i: immutable, not modifiable by any user, no hard linking
            a: append write mode only
            d: file not backed up with dump program
            A: no atime update when file is accessed but not modified
        * `chattr [+|-|=mode] filename`: change attributes
        * `lsattr filename`: views attributes
  * `mkfs` is the command for **formatting** a filesystem on a partition, but is  
    a frontend for specific programs:
        ls -lh /sbin/mkfs*
        -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root  11K Nov 18 06:32 /sbin/mkfs
        -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 273K Oct  8 10:59 /sbin/mkfs.btrfs
        -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root  32K Nov 18 06:32 /sbin/mkfs.cramfs
        -rwxr-xr-x. 5 root root 109K Jun 17  2015 /sbin/mkfs.ext2
        -rwxr-xr-x. 5 root root 109K Jun 17  2015 /sbin/mkfs.ext3
        -rwxr-xr-x. 5 root root 109K Jun 17  2015 /sbin/mkfs.ext4
        -rwxr-xr-x. 5 root root 109K Jun 17  2015 /sbin/mkfs.ext4dev
        -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root  32K Sep 18 12:28 /sbin/mkfs.fat
        -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root  73K Nov 18 06:32 /sbin/mkfs.minix
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root    8 Sep 18 12:28 /sbin/mkfs.msdos -> mkfs.fat
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root   16 Jun 17  2015 /sbin/mkfs.ntfs -> /usr/sbin/mkntfs
        lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root    8 Sep 18 12:28 /sbin/mkfs.vfat -> mkfs.fat
        -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 323K Jul 30 12:00 /sbin/mkfs.xfs
    * are equivalent:
          sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda10
          sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda10
    * general form:
          mkfs [t fstype] [options] [device-file]
    * use `man mkfs.[filesystem]` for more options
  * `fsck` is frontend for filesystem-specific programs to check for errors:
        ls -lh /sbin/fsck*
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  44K Nov  2 18:04 /sbin/fsck
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  35K Nov  2 18:04 /sbin/fsck.cramfs
        -rwxr-xr-x 5 root root 251K Aug  6 05:43 /sbin/fsck.ext2
        -rwxr-xr-x 5 root root 251K Aug  6 05:43 /sbin/fsck.ext3
        -rwxr-xr-x 5 root root 251K Aug  6 05:43 /sbin/fsck.ext4
        -rwxr-xr-x 5 root root 251K Aug  6 05:43 /sbin/fsck.ext4dev
        -rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 395K May 16  2013 /sbin/fsck.jfs
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  76K Nov  2 18:04 /sbin/fsck.minix
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   10 Aug 27  2013 /sbin/fsck.reiserfs -> reiserfsck
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  433 Sep  8 02:42 /sbin/fsck.xfs
    * are equivalent:
          sudo fsck -t ext4 /dev/sda10
          sudo fsck.ext4 /dev/sda10
    * `fsck` is run after a set number of mounts or after an abnormal shutdown.  
      It can only run on an unmounted filesystem. You can force a check of all  
      mounted filesystems at next boot with:
          sudo touch /forcefsck
          sudo reboot
    * general format is:
          fsck [-t fstype] [options] [device-file]
      * `-r`: manually fix errors
      * `-a`: automatically fix errors as best as possible
  * **Linux** can join multiple filesystems under one directory tree under `/`  
    using `mount` and `umount`, with `mount` attaching them and `umount` detaching  
    them
    * `mount point`: directory where filesystem is attached
    * the `mount point` must exist before mounting, all files under `mount point`  
      are hidden until the overlaid filesystem is unmounted
    * only the superuser can mount/unmount
    * all usages of `mount` below are equivalent:
          sudo mount /dev/sda2 /home
          sudo mount LABEL=home /home
          sudo mount -L home /home
          sudo mount UUID=26d58ee2-9d20-4dc7-b6ab-aa87c3cfb69a /home
          sudo mount -U 26d58ee2-9d20-4dc7-b6ab-aa87c3cfb69a /home
    * labels are assigned by filesystem utilities like `e2label`, and **UUID**s  
      are assigned when the partition is created
    * mounting by **UUID** is preferred, then by label, finally by device node
    * `mount -a`: mount all filesystems in `/etc/fstab`
    * `umount [device-name|mount-point]`: unm0unt a mounted filesystem
      * cannot be done while filesystems in use by a process:
        * use `fuser` to find out which user is accessing the filesystem
        * use `lsof` to see which files are being accessed that may block unmounting
    * `/etc/fstab`: file of mount listing used to mount at boot and for `mount -a`,
      among other things
    * each record has fields separated by whitespace:
          1. device node, label or UUID, none for tmpfs, proc, sysfs, etc.
          2. mount point
          3. filesystem type
          4. comma-separated list of options
          5. dump frequency, or a 0, used by 'dump -w' command
          6. 'fsck' pass number (or 0 meaning do not check state at boot)
    * with a record in `/etc/fstab`, just the mount point can be given to `mount`  
      to mount a filesystem:
          sudo mount /usr/src
      instead of:
          sudo mount LABEL=src /usr/src
    * `mount`: raw command lists mounted filesystems
