### 34. Group Management

* Groups are defined in `/etc/group` in a colon-delimited list of lines, fields  
  being:

    * groupname : name of group
    * password : password of group, normally a placeholder
    * GID : group identifier; values between 100 and `GID_MIN` (defined in
      `/etc/login.defs`)are special; values over that are User Private Groups
    * user1,user2,... : comma-separated list of users who are members of the group,
      principal group's user need not be listed

  * Add a group:
        groupadd [-g GID] <groupname>

    Delete a group:
        groupdel <groupname>

    Modify a group's properties:
        $ groupmod --help
        Usage: groupmod [options] GROUP

        Options:
          -g, --gid GID                 change the group ID to GID
          -h, --help                    display this help message and exit
          -n, --new-name NEW_GROUP      change the name to NEW_GROUP
          -o, --non-unique              allow to use a duplicate (non-unique) GID
          -p, --password PASSWORD       change the password to this (encrypted)
                                        PASSWORD
          -R, --root CHROOT_DIR         directory to chroot into

  * User Private Groups (UPGs) ensuer that each user has its own group, where GID  
    = UID and the group name is identical to the user name.

    The **umask** for users with UPG is 002, so new files are created with 664  
    permissions and directories with 775 permissions.

  * A user can belong to up to 15 secondary groups besides the primary group (GID  
    in `/etc/passwd` file).

    This grants the user additional permissions. One can list their groups with:
        groups [user1 user2 ...]
        id -Gn [user1 user2 ...]
