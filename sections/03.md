### 3. GRUB

  * **G** rand **U** nified **B** oot **L** oader
  * older systems use `GRUB 1`, newer systems have migrated to `GRUB 2`
  * `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` or `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` for `GRUB 2` are read at boot,
    auto-generated by `update-grub` (or `ugrub2-mkconfig` on **RHEL**) based on
    files in `/etc/grub.d/` and `/etc/default/grub`, but the latter should not be
    hand-edited
  * `/boot/grub/grub.conf` and `/boot/grub/menu.lst` are config files for `GRUB 1`
    but shouldn't be hand-edited. `grubby` in **RHEL** 5-7 is normally used
  * once booted to the `GRUB` menu, `e` can be pressed to edit an entry
  * `GRUB 2` install with `sudo grub2-install /dev/file`
  * `GRUB 1` install with `grub-install` or `sudo grub` to enter `grub` prompt, then:
    ```
    >root (hd0,0)
    >setup (hd0)
    >exit
    ```
  * in version 1, hard drives are `hd0`, `hd1`, etc, and partitions start at 0
  * in version 2, hard drives are `hd0`, `hd1`, etc, and partitions start at 1
  * the *root* partition, in `GRUB` lingo, is the partition the kernel is
    stored, i.e.: in the `/boot` directory
