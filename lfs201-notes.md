# LFS201
## Notes by Jeremiah Richter

1. ### Course Introduction
  * nothing  to note
  * Use LFS101x.2 as reference
  * notes for that course located [here](./lfs101-notes.md "lfs101-notes")
  * two levels, **LFCS** and **LFCE**
  * find **domains** and **competencies** [here](http://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification)
  * only most common options listed
  * for x86-based machines, assuming 64-bit
  * focus on **Enterprise Linux** distros, like:
    * **RHEL** (RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX)
    * **SUSE**
    * **Ubuntu**, probably 14.04 LTS release
    * virtual install recommended to avoid damage to a working installation
  * 12 months access to course
  * There are labs and exercises with answer solutions, but they are not
    graded, no final exam
  * `Gnome` is focused on because of the larger user base, not because of a
    preference
  * **Linux Foundation** is a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the
    growth of Linux. It sponsors the work of Linus Torvalds, organizes LinuxCon,
    manages the Linux trademark, and supports the Linux Standards Base
2. ### System Startup and Shutdown
  * boot sequence steps:
    1. **BIOS/UEFI** locates and executes the boot program/loader
    2. the boot loader loads the kernel
    3. the kernel starts the `init` process (`pid=1`)
    4. `init` manages system usage using **SysVinit** startup scripts, or
      using **Upstart** or **systemd**
  * the **BIOS** loads the boot loader from the **MBR**
  * boot loaders:
          GRUB (most common)
          LILO (obsolete)
          efilinux (for UEFI)
          Das U-Boot (embedded)
  * config files are in `/etc`:
    * Debian uses `/etc/default`
    * RHEL uses `/etc/sysconfig`
    * Newer Redhat-based and SUSE use both
    * scripts in `/etc/init.d/` may use environmental variables from
      `/etc/sysconfig` or `/etc/default`
  * `shutdown` halts or reboots the system:
    * `-h +num/now [message]`: power off, must be followed by a `+num` for 'num'
      minutes in the future, `now` for now, and an optional `message`
    * `-r`: reboots the system
    * `-k`: just sends a message to logged-in users, no shutdown
    * `-c`: cancel pending shutdown
  * `reboot/halt/poweroff`: legacy equivalents
3. ### GRUB
  * **G** rand **U** nified **B** oot **L** oader
  * older systems use `GRUB 1`, newer systems have migrated to `GRUB 2`
  * `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` or `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` for `GRUB 2` are read at boot,
    auto-generated by `update-grub` (or `ugrub2-mkconfig` on **RHEL**) based on
    files in `/etc/grub.d/` and `/etc/default/grub`, but the latter should not be
    hand-edited
  * `/boot/grub/grub.conf` and `/boot/grub/menu.lst` are config files for `GRUB 1`
    but shouldn't be hand-edited. `grubby` in **RHEL** 5-7 is normally used
  * once booted to the `GRUB` menu, `e` can be pressed to enter an interactive
    shell
