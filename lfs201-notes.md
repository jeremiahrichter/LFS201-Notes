# LFS201
## Notes by Jeremiah Richter

### 1. Course Introduction

  * nothing  to note
  * Use LFS101x.2 as reference
  * notes for that course located [here](./lfs101-notes.md "lfs101-notes")
  * two levels, **LFCS** and **LFCE**
  * find **domains** and **competencies** [here](http://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification)
  * only most common options listed
  * for x86-based machines, assuming 64-bit
  * focus on **Enterprise Linux** distros, like:
    * **RHEL** (RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX)
    * **SUSE**
    * **Ubuntu**, probably 14.04 LTS release
    * virtual install recommended to avoid damage to a working installation
  * 12 months access to course
  * There are labs and exercises with answer solutions, but they are not
    graded, no final exam
  * `Gnome` is focused on because of the larger user base, not because of a
    preference
  * **Linux Foundation** is a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the
    growth of Linux. It sponsors the work of Linus Torvalds, organizes LinuxCon,
    manages the Linux trademark, and supports the Linux Standards Base

### 2. System Startup and Shutdown

  * boot sequence steps:
    1. **BIOS/UEFI** locates and executes the boot program/loader
    2. the boot loader loads the kernel
    3. the kernel starts the `init` process (`pid=1`)
    4. `init` manages system usage using **SysVinit** startup scripts, or
      using **Upstart** or **systemd**
  * the **BIOS** loads the boot loader from the **MBR**
  * boot loaders:
    ```
    GRUB (most common)
    LILO (obsolete)
    efilinux (for UEFI)
    Das U-Boot (embedded)
    ```
  * config files are in `/etc`:
    * Debian uses `/etc/default`
    * RHEL uses `/etc/sysconfig`
    * Newer Redhat-based and SUSE use both
    * scripts in `/etc/init.d/` may use environmental variables from
      `/etc/sysconfig` or `/etc/default`
  * `shutdown` halts or reboots the system:
    * `-h +num/now [message]`: power off, must be followed by a `+num` for 'num'
      minutes in the future, `now` for now, and an optional `message`
    * `-r`: reboots the system
    * `-k`: just sends a message to logged-in users, no shutdown
    * `-c`: cancel pending shutdown
  * `reboot/halt/poweroff`: legacy equivalents

### 3. GRUB

  * **G** rand **U** nified **B** oot **L** oader
  * older systems use `GRUB 1`, newer systems have migrated to `GRUB 2`
  * `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` or `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` for `GRUB 2` are read at boot,
    auto-generated by `update-grub` (or `ugrub2-mkconfig` on **RHEL**) based on
    files in `/etc/grub.d/` and `/etc/default/grub`, but the latter should not be
    hand-edited
  * `/boot/grub/grub.conf` and `/boot/grub/menu.lst` are config files for `GRUB 1`
    but shouldn't be hand-edited. `grubby` in **RHEL** 5-7 is normally used
  * once booted to the `GRUB` menu, `e` can be pressed to edit an entry
  * `GRUB 2` install with `sudo grub2-install /dev/file`
  * `GRUB 1` install with `grub-install` or `sudo grub` to enter `grub` prompt, then:
    ```
    >root (hd0,0)
    >setup (hd0)
    >exit
    ```
  * in version 1, hard drives are `hd0`, `hd1`, etc, and partitions start at 0
  * in version 2, hard drives are `hd0`, `hd1`, etc, and partitions start at 1
  * the *root* partition, in `GRUB` lingo, is the partition the kernel is
    stored, i.e.: in the `/boot` directory

### 4. init: SystemV, Upstart, Systemd

  * `/sbin/init`: first user-level process run on the system and runs until
    shutdown, configures environment, starts login process
  * **SysVinit** was for multi-user mainframes, single processor, each stage must
    complete before next stage of startup could begin, *serial* process
  * **Upstart** was developed in 2006 by Ubuntu
  * **Systemd** is more recent, adopted first by Fedora in 2011
    * is now default for every major Linux distros
  * `sysvinit`-compatibility layers will persist for the foreseeable future
    * `sysvinit` passes through various *runlevels*, or stages, which define
      different states, numbered 0-6, here are Red Hat's runlevels:
      ```
      0 system halt state
      1 single-user mode
      2 distro-defined (multi-user without networking)
      3 distro-defined (multi-user with networking, CLI)
      4 distro-defined (not used)
      5 distro-defined (multi-user, usually X and networking)
      6 reboot
      s same as 1
      ```
    * `runlevel` displays previous and current runlevel, `N` is unknown runlevel
    * `telinit 'runlevel'`: changes runlevel to 'runlevel'
    * `/etc/inittab`: traditionally told `init` which scripts to run at which
      runlevel, lines are written `id:runlevel:action:process`:
      ```
      id:       1-4 chars, unique, for each entry
      runlevel: zero or more chars/digits to identify runlevel
      action:   action to take
      process:  process to be executed
      ```
      in Red Hat there is only the one line `id:5:initdefault`, which states the
      default runlevel
    * `/etc/rc.sysinit` script would mount filesystems, etc., this was usually a
      symbolic link to `/etc/rc.d/{somefile}`, then `/etc/rc` script was run with
      desired runlevel as an argument. The system would then look in
      `/etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d/` and run the scripts in there
    * `/etc/rc.local` would start system-specific scripts
    * Note:
      * all startup scripts are in `/etc/init.d/`; each runlevel links to them
      * **start** scripts start with an **S**
      * **kill** scripts begin with an **K**
      * script's name is then the name of the service, one manages scripts by
        managing links, can be manual or with `chkconfig`
    * `chkconfig servicename`: check if set to run in current runlevel
    * `chkconfig --list [service_names]`: what services in which runlevels
    * `sudo chkconfig service on`: enables service to run on next boot
    * `sudo chkconfig service off`: reverses the above
    * `sudo chkconfig service [start | stop]`: starts/stops service now without
      reboot
    * add script with certain lines to `/etc/init.d/`, run `chkconfig --add` to
      enable, `chkconfig --del` to disable
        * example line: `# chkconfig 2345 10 90` runs in 2-5 runlevels, starts
        with priority `S10` script, ends with `590` script
    * `sudo service 'service' status` command would check service status of
      script in `/etc/init.d/`
    * `sudo service 'servicename' {start|stop|restart|reload|status}` are the
      usual options
    * `sudo service --status-all` for all services
    * recent versions of Ubuntu won't use `chkconfig`:
      * `sudo invoke-rc.d service [status|start|stop]` or `sudo status 'service'`
      * `sudo update-rc.d 'service' [defaults|purge]`
      * `sudo sysv-rc-conf 'service' [on|off]`
  * `Upstart` is *event-driven*, rather than serial; events are sent to `init` to
    tell it to execute certain commands when prerequisites are met; superseded by
    `systemd`, config files:
    ```
    /etc/init/rcS.conf
    /etc/rc-sysinit.conf
    /etc/inittab
    /etc/init/rc.conf
    /etc/rc[0-6].d
    ```
    * kernel starts `init`, which starts `rcS.conf`, which runs `rc-sysinit.conf`
    * `rc-sysinit.conf` will do startup tasks, like LVM and filesystems, then run
      the `/etc/inittab` runlevel. This runlevel is sent to script `rc.conf`.
      Additional scripts, like `prefdm.conf` for runlevel 5, are run.
    * Upstart events are found in `/etc/event.d`, startup jobs are in `/etc/init`
    * `initctl` is like service, use `initctl options command`, options are:
      ```
      start: starts a job
      stop: stops a job
      restart: restart a job
      reload: sends HUP signal to job
      status: gets job status
      list: list known jobs
      emit: emit an event
      ```
  * `systemd` is backwards-compatible with `sysvinit` and uses *targets* to emulate
    runlevels, emulates `telinit`, socket and D-Bus activation, *parallel* startup,
    doesn't need shell scripts, uses *cgroups*, can mount/unmount, can be drop-in
    replacement for `sysvinit`
    * uses `.service` files to delineate services
    * standard config files:
    ```
    /etc/vconsole.conf: default keymapping and console Foundation
    /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf: drop-in directory for kernel sysctl parameters
    /etc/os-release: distro ID file
    ```
    * `systemctl` is main utility for service management:
      * `systemctl [options] command [name]`: usage
      * `systemctl list-units -t service`: list active services
      * `sudo systemctl [start|stop] 'service'`: start/stop unit
      * `sudo systemctl [enable|disable] 'service'`: enable/disable unit
