### 40. Firewalls

  * Firewalls can be configured:
    * from CLI tools using files in `/etc/`:
          iptables
          firewall-cmd
          ufw
    * or graphical tools:
          system-config-firewall
          firewall-config
          gufw
          yast

  * `firewalld` is part of `systemd` systems, config files are:
        /etc/firewalld
        /usr/lib/firewalld

    The actual command is `firewall-cmd`. It replaces the older `iptables` and
    should not be run concurrently.

    Show if it's running:
        sudo firewall-cmd --state
